# Meshrix.js

## Product and authority

Meshrix.js owns its private Node.js platform. Keep its implementation, paths,
commands, evidence, and history private; never project them into the public
Meshrix repository or describe public work as originating here. Public Go work
uses `$meshrix`. Work touching both products keeps separate contracts, source,
tests, evidence, and completion claims.

Authoritative Meshrix.js skills live in this repository's `skills/` directory.
Each skill declares `audience: usage` or `audience: development` in its
YAML frontmatter. Usage skills ship with installs and offline projections
(`npm run pack:usage-skills` → `build/usage-skills`); development skills stay
in the repository checkout. Distribution and installed packages are generated
from these sources. They are projections, not independent places to edit
policy. Use the current repository's AGENTS.md, source, and command
definitions when a distribution is stale; report the distribution defect and
continue authorized work.

Meshrix.js follows a self-owned implementation route for its core Node.js
platform and infrastructure. Do not apply the public Go dependency-admission
table here or replace owned protocol, gateway, permission, queue, state, plugin,
storage, audit, or runtime authorities with third-party frameworks merely
because the Go product admits them. Existing runtime, UI, database-driver,
cryptographic, and edge utility dependencies do not transfer those authorities.
Any exception requires an explicit maintainer decision for this private product.

## Route the task

- `$meshrix-js-developer-handbook` owns source, packaging, and release-artifact
  work; apply `$meshrix-js-repository` for repository changes.
- `$meshrix-js-user-handbook` owns operating an instance and connecting external
  systems. One authorized task may contain development followed by instance
  verification; retain each step's owner, authorization, and evidence claim.
- `$meshrix-js-regression-planner` selects focused checks and final integration.
  Load only the specialist skills needed for the accepted outcome.

| Common task | First specialist |
| --- | --- |
| Diagnose denied access or an empty tool catalog | `$meshrix-js-operation-permission`; use `$meshrix-js-api-key-issuance` only for an authorized new key |
| Connect a standard MCP client | `$meshrix-js-downstream-mcp-client-access`, then the relevant agent reference if needed |
| Develop a Plugin, client adapter, or Service | `$meshrix-js-developer-handbook` and its extension ownership reference |
| Build an offline archive | `$meshrix-js-offline-pack` with an explicit product repository |
| Change Console source | `$meshrix-js-repository` and `$meshrix-js-frontend-visual-direction` |
| Change documentation or skills | `$meshrix-js-regression-planner` for focused checks |

Preserve unrelated work and finish every replacement claimed by the selected
outcome. Record other gaps with their owning workflow; they do not expand the
current task automatically. Existing explicit authorization remains valid for
the same target, operation, and effects. New authority or a material unresolved
decision needs user input; continue independent authorized work meanwhile.
Applicable script-repair, regression-failure, dependency, and publication
approvals remain required. Plans, routing, successful tests, and command flags
never grant execution authority.

For skill maintenance, use the [bounded task scenarios](references/maintenance-scenarios.md)
to review routing and observable outcomes after changing an entry or helper.

## Plugin and Service boundaries

A Plugin is a target-specific native TypeScript/Node.js extension coupled to
Host contracts, lifecycle, capability registration, and interoperability.
Process isolation does not make it a Service. A Service exposes an independent,
language-neutral remote contract and can serve clients without Meshrix.js.
Direct Service access belongs to its own operator's governance. A native
Plugin may adapt a Service without merging the two boundaries.
