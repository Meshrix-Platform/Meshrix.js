# Meshrix.js Storage Operations

## Diagnose before mutation

Identify the canonical metadata and object ownership first. Compare upload session state, committed offsets, object digests, job identity, and persisted artifacts without dumping raw contents.

Prefer linear indexing by stable IDs, streaming hashes and transfers, bounded concurrency, buffer reuse, explicit timeouts, and exponential backoff with jitter. Avoid repeated scans or per-chunk full-buffer allocation.

## Separate plans from writes

Use read-only inspection and dry-run reconciliation first. Treat repair, rebuild, export, upload, and runtime-data access as side effects.

Select the owning verification with `$meshrix-js-regression-planner` before
execution. Runtime-data or destructive tasks require explicit authorization
for the exact target and effects; use the owning command's documented
side-effect admission when supported. A flag is not authorization, and the
same already-authorized operation does not require another permission request.

Report counts, stable object or job IDs, digest prefixes, and outcomes. Do not report local paths, filenames containing personal data, raw documents, or database rows.
