# Agent adaptation sources

Vendor references below were checked on 2026-09-08. They are rolling documents,
not a tested client-version matrix. Retained facts in each target entry are
limited to the linked configuration surface. Recheck an affected fact when a
client version or requested behavior changes; no scheduled audit is required.

The [official Linux app reference](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/linux/linux-app)
documents the OpenAI Linux desktop preview. Vendor availability does not
establish Meshrix.js qualification.

## Evidence ownership

- Vendor documentation owns vendor configuration and supported product forms.
- Current `plugins/agents/<target>/adapter.mjs` files own packaged MCP lifecycle
  behavior; the installer catalog owns the installed first-party component identities.
- `docs/COMPATIBILITY.md` owns named-client qualification requirements.
- A missing implementation reference is not evidence that a vendor feature
  does not exist. Remove unsupported implementation claims or label the
  specific unverified scope; do not manufacture a closed-gap status.
- Use portable path templates. Do not scan personal histories, databases,
  credentials, or application data to populate these references.

When changing a fact, update this index and its target entry, then regenerate
the distribution from canonical skills. Do not edit installed projections or
introduce a separate skill lock.
